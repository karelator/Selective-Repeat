# Reliable Data Transport Simulator

Simulates reliable data transfer over an unreliable network using the **Selective Repeat ARQ** algorithm.  
Built for the INF-2300 Networking course (UiT â€“ The Arctic University of Norway).

##  Overview
- Models the **Application**, **Transport**, and **Network** layers of the OSI stack.  
- Handles **packet loss**, **delay**, and **corruption**.  
- Implements **Selective Repeat** for reliable, ordered delivery.
- Adjust network behavior in **config.py**

##  Run
```bash 
cd src
python simulation.py
```
